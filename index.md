# Yu-Gi-Oh! AR Dueling System (YARDS) - Manual

### Changelog
* 22 Oct 2018 Starting steps.

# Before We Start

This manual is an english recreation by [My1](https://github.com/My1) of the [Japanese YARDS Manual](https://reoasxdtmgt.github.io/YARDS-manual/) by [Reo](https://twitter.com/reoasxdtmgt), creator of the YARDS System.

While I would love to help Reo from time to time with some english stuff, I am in no way, shape or form, affiliated with him, and therefore this manual is not official (YARDS itself isn't either, but whatever :-) )

With languages obviously being a very difficult subject in general and not everything being easy to translate word by word, I still attempt to bring the broad meaning and intentions of Reo, if you have any issue with the content or wording of this manual, [please file an issue](https://github.com/My1/YARDS-manual-EN/issues).

# Summary
Many Yu-Gi-Oh! Players around the world probably imagined how it would be if they would be able to play with the Solid Vision System seen time and time again in the Anime.
While it is yet impossibly to let monsters appear into thin air yet, if we remove that element, we have a decent starting point.

This manual is made to introduce the YARDS system and how to use it. While the Official Yu-Gi-Oh! Games as well as many third party projects process everything by themselves, the technology for creating such an advanced AI isn't available to us yet, therefore the entire system will be controlled with smartphones (or tablets and similar devices).

While controlling the system through your control device while doing the actual Duel is more work than usual, you are not required to use all functions, you can decide on what functions you like to use and only use those.

It would be really nice if this system would spread as a new way to play Yu-Gi-Oh!. Please try it out!

# Basic screen data

Fundamentally, there are 2 big sections of the client. The `Login Screen` and the `Home Screen`, with the Home Screen having 4 tabs.

Also on the Special summoning methods of Fusion, Ritual, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum and Link (all together named as `Extra Summon`) each have their own sub-screen for managing those.

## Login Screen
To use this system, both players need to Log in and select themselves as either Player 1 or Player 2.

From the top:

* Login as Player 1/2: Log you in as the respective Player
* Logout: If you are signed in as any Player, you can use this button to Log out again
* Duel Stand by...: if both players are logged in, this starts the Duel, and moves both Players over to the Home Screen.
